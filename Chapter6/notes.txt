double result = Math.PI * radius * radius;

incremental development:
The key aspects of incremental development are:
• Start with a working program and make small, incremental changes. At any
point, if there is an error, you will know where to look.
• Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can check them, either with
print statements or by using a debugger.
• Once the program is working, you can consolidate multiple statements into com‐
pound expressions (but only if it does not make the program more difficult to
read).

overloading
Having more than one method with the same name is called overloading, and it is legal in
Java as long as each version takes different parameters.

Javadoc tags generate html features
/**
* Tests whether x is a single digit integer.
*
* @param x the integer to test
* @return true if x has one digit, false otherwise
*/
Methods with multiple parameters should have separate @param tags that describe
each one. Void methods should have no @return tag, since they do not return a value.
