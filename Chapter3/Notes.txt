format inline printing:
System.out.printf("%d in = %f cm\n", inch, cm);
often ends with \n, newline character.

common options:
%d integer
%08d integer padded with PRECEEDING zeros
%f float
%0.2f float rounded to two decimals
%s sting

force conversion:
(int) x
(float) y

Parenthesis force operatuion before conversion
(int) (x/ y)

it is good practice to declare constants and variables at top of main.
