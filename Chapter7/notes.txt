While statements:
1. Evaluate the condition, yielding true or false .
2. If the condition is false , skip the body and go to the next statement.
3. If the condition is true , execute the body and go back to step 1.

program development process called “encapsulation and generalization”. The steps are:
1. Write a few lines of code in main or another method, and test them.
2. When they are working, wrap them in a new method, and test again.
3. If it’s appropriate, replace literal values with variables and parameters.
The second step is called encapsulation; the third step is generalization.

The format specifier %4d causes the output to align vertically, regardless.


For Loops:
public static void printTable(int rows) {
	for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i = i + 1) {
		printRow(i, rows);
	}
}

for loops have three components in parentheses, separated by semicolons: the initial‐
izer, the condition, and the update.
1. The initializer runs once at the very beginning of the loop.
2. The condition is checked each time through the loop. If it is false , the loop ends.
Otherwise, the body of the loop is executed (again).
3. At the end of each iteration, the update runs, and we go back to step 2.

While and For loops evaluate before an iteration. Do-While loops are guarenteed to execute once before they evaluate for the condition.
